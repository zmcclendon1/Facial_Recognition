# Facial_Recognition
This is a simple program I made in python to detect smiles, when a smile is detected a screenshot of the entire screen is saved this program can be used in the background to take screenshots as well. This is one of my first python projects I'm starting to use python in school so I decided why not try to larn the language a little better with a stupid project.
